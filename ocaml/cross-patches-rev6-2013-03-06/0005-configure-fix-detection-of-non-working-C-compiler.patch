Subject: [PATCH 05/34] configure: fix detection of non-working C compiler.

The test tried to do something like:
  case "$foo,$bar" in
    *,*) echo 1 ;;
    *) echo "compiler not working" ;;
   esac
However the second case cannot match because of the first one.

Instead, check the return code of the command.
