Subject: [PATCH 10/34] configure: add a special case to test for BSD sockets
 for mingw.

I tried to use "hasgot" to test it but proved too difficult since you
must #include <winsock2.h> to make link succeed (windows magic) which
then makes gcc complain about the prototype being wrong.

Since windows already needs a special case in order to add -lws2_32 and
since we know for sure it will be available, skip the hasgot test and
check $target directly.
